Challenge
We want to see if your skill-set aligns with the internship you're applying to. Ignore core value #10 for a minute and show us what you've got!

Please complete the challenge below and send it back to us by replying to this email once you have completed the challenge and virtual interview.

Your challenge is to build an app that takes input from the user as a search query and returns the first item (there could be more than one) and display it as a product page. You do not need to make it look like our app, show us how you would build this from scratch using your own design. The app should have a floating action button on the screen that does some sort of animation to indicate that something has been added to a cart. You will use databinding for the product page you create.

Requirements:
• Databinding for the product page ( https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html )
• Animation when floating action button clicked ( https://developer.android.com/training/animation/index.html )

Bonus points for:
• Following Material Design guidelines ( https://material.io/guidelines/ )
• Well handled configuration changes ( https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html )
• Using retrofit to handle your REST requests ( https://square.github.io/retrofit/ )

The following REST requests can be used to get back search results: https://api.zappos.com/Search?term=&key=b743e26728e16b81da139182bb2094357c31d331

Example:
https://api.zappos.com/Search?term=nike&key=b743e26728e16b81da139182bb2094357c31d331

If you completed the above challenge with ease, try these:
• “Share” a product to nearby friends who have your app running on their phone such that they are able to view the same product (when clicking on the shared link or some other awesome magical way)
• Follow a modern design pattern; be prepared to justify your architectural decisions.

Deliverables:
1. Release build.apk file
2. Public git repository url for viewing your source code
3. Title your project ILoveZappos
